## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Proper setup of Tailwind (initializing config file, setting up script for build with PostCSS, dependencies, etc.).

### Continued development

- I did not quite get the [Prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) to work correctly. It would certainly help for slightly easier readability on long class names that have many utilities applied to them.
- More organized file structure.
- I could not get the paragraph padding <i>just</i> right how I wanted it to be. Practice makes perfect! :grin:

### Useful resources

The Tailwind official documentation is loaded with helpful examples, including code snippets and screenshots. Specifically, the [Editor Setup](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup) was most helpful for a smooth VS Code experience.
